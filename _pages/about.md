I am a seasoned scientist & engineer working in the field of Machine Learning Systems with a primary focus on the optimization of large-scale distributed training and inference systems for foundation models and large language models (LLMs). Distinct from many other ML Systems researchers, my work also extends into core modeling research. My core modeling research mainly focuses on efficient AI—particularly LLM compression, knowledge distillation, LLM post-training methodologies, Agentic Reinforcement Learning and Vision-Language Models (VLM). Some of the research findings are published in *EMNLP, ICCV, ECCV, WACV, ICML and NeurIPS etc.* 

**Some of the representative ML Systems that I was involved in the development phase** including [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeed), one of the most popular OSS LLM distributed training library (code maintainer and TSC Committer); [fmchisel](https://github.com/linkedin/fmchisel), the state-of-the-art Foundation Models Optimization research library (e.g. knowledge distillation,compression and quantization etc); and [Liger Kernel](https://github.com/linkedin/Liger-Kernel) (Kudos to Byron Hsu and Yun Dai et al for the awesome work, and I am happy to support the work as the manager). 

In the corporate world, I am Senior Manager/Senior Staff Research Scientist leading the Foundational AI algorithms organization at LinkedIn (subsidary of Microsoft). Previously I worked at AWS AI organization at Amazon, where I was leading the SageMaker Applied Science Team contributing to LLM Inference/Distributed Training and Evaluation Services. I was also the Tech Lead Manager/Staff Software Engineer at Google[X]/Google Research, where I was building up the machine learning team for the Moonshot project [Chorus](https://x.company/projects/chorus/) and engaged in AIDA project building [coding agent using LLM](https://x.company/projects/aida/) (now part of Gemini). I was also involved in PaLM model development work across Alphabet. Before that I was Staff Research Scientist at Apple, where I lead the development of ML Algorithms for [Sleep Apnea Detection on Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/health/pdf/sleep-apnea/Sleep_Apnea_Notifications_on_Apple_Watch_September_2024.pdf).
